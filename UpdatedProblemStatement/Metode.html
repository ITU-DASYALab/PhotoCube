<p><b>Metode:</b><br/>
First, I familiarized myself with the M³ model and the theory behind it. Next, I looked into the O³ and P³ implementations, which resulted in a need to be implemented from scratch due to maintainability problems. I then developed a smaller web server and database application to serve as the O³ substitute. I also designed and started developing the web browser based P³ client implementation.<br/><br/>

I am now to further design and develop the web-based client implementation, as well as the smaller server and database implementation that it communicates with, discussing and developing in a SCRUM like fashion with my supervisor, prioritizing the most important tasks first. When the implementations are done, and we get towards the end of the thesis period, I will make a qualitative evaluation of the new implementations against the older implementations, and compare the new implementations with other products and research projects on the market. I am also to finish writing the report documenting the implementations, the theory behind them, the evaluations and the findings.<br/><br/>

<b>Plan</b><br/>
What has been done in the previous 5 months (September 2018 - January 2019):
<ul>
<li>I have familiarized myself with the M³ model and the theory behind it through literature and talks with Björn.</li>
<li>I have familiarized myself with the previous O³ and P³ implementations.</li>
<li>I have implemented large parts of the web server and database implementation and web-based client implementation - but these are not done yet.</li>
<li>I have written large parts of the report - but this is not done yet either.</li>
</ul>

What will be done in the remaining 2 months (February 2019 and March 2019):
<ul>
<li>In February I will try to finish the web server and web-based client implementations.</li>
<li>In March I will evaluate the new implementations against the old, compare the new implementations with related products and research projects on the market, and finish the report.</li>
</ul></p>
